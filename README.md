# Just Practicing React
The project is created with Vite. You can run it doing **"npm install"** and then **"npm run dev"**.

### Functional Components
A component is the base of React and they can be defined as **classes** or **functions**.

We can defined a Function Component like this:
![Code](/public/examples/component.png)
![Visual](/public/examples/card.png)

Like all of the React components we have Props, that means we can pass the component whatever information we want that component to render and allows us to re-use the component layout with different content.

Looking like this:

### Conditional Components
Using conditional components will allow us to control what to render only if the condition is correct.

We created an available or not available check compontent wich renders **weather the disable prop is True or False**:

This looks like this:
